description: >
  This configuration defines the event patterns and behaviors for the simulation.
  Users can specify event types, volumes, and distribution functions for event generation.

# Define the overall time range for the dataset
start_time: "2024-12-09T00:00:00Z"  # Start time for the dataset
end_time: "2024-12-15T23:59:59Z"    # End time for the dataset

event_frequencies:
  # Define any global event frequencies here if needed
  web_traffic: "no-op"  # Example of a frequency setting
